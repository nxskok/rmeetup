## Pig feed

20 pigs are randomly assigned to one of four pig feeds, and the weight gain of each pig is measured

```
pig feed1 feed2 feed3 feed4
1    57.0  67.7  92.1  84.2
2    65.0  74.0  90.2  83.1
3    58.6  66.3  96.5  85.7
4    60.8  68.7  92.6  87.9
5    61.7  69.8  99.1  90.3
```


this one:

```
Species     Disease present         Disease absent
       Location X Location Y  Location X Location Y
A            44         12          38        10
B            28         22          20        18
```

one where I use .value

summarize with list, eg the exam one
reformat the data so I have to process it first
