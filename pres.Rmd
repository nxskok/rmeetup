## Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Pig feed

20 pigs are randomly assigned to one of four pig feeds, and the weight gain of each pig is measured:

```
pig feed1 feed2 feed3 feed4
 1   60.8  68.7  92.6  87.9
 2   57.0  67.7  92.1  84.2
 3   65.0  74.0  90.2  83.1
 4   58.6  66.3  96.5  85.7
 5   61.7  69.8  99.1  90.3
```

Say we want graphs of weight gain for each feed.

## Read in:


```{r, message=F}
pigs <- read_table("pigs1.txt")
pigs
```


## and then we have to do this 4 times...

```{r}
ggplot(pigs, aes(x=1, y=feed1)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## The problem

- The data frame is the *wrong shape*.
- Need all the weight gains in *one* column, with another column saying what feed that weight gain was from
- Make data frame longer.
- Old tools:
  - `reshape`
  - `reshape2`
  - `gather` (from `tidyr`)
- New tool: `pivot_longer`

## On the pig feed data

```{r}
pigs
pigs %>% pivot_longer(-pig, names_to="feed", 
                      values_to="weight") -> pigs_longer
```

## The results (some)

```{r}
pigs_longer %>% sample_n(10)
```


## Now we can make all 4 graphs at once

```{r}
ggplot(pigs_longer, aes(x=feed, y=weight)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Making wider

`pivot_wider` is inverse of `pivot_longer`:

```{r}
pigs_longer %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=feed, values_from=weight)
```

we are back where we started.

## Disease presence and absence at two locations

Frequencies of plants observed with and without disease at two locations:

```
Species     Disease present         Disease absent
       Location X Location Y  Location X Location Y
A            44         12          38        10
B            28         22          20        18
```

This has two rows of headers, so I rewrote the data file:

```
Species  present_x present_y    absent_x  absent_y
A            44         12          38        10
B            28         22          20        18
```

Read into data frame called `prevalence`.

## Gather

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
prevalence <- read_table("disease.txt")
```

needs to take two steps:

```{r}
prevalence %>% 
  gather(disloc, freq, -Species) %>% 
  separate(disloc, into=c("disease", "location"))
```


## Making longer, the new way

```{r}
prevalence %>% 
  pivot_longer(-Species, names_to=c("disease", "location"),
               names_sep="_", values_to="frequency") %>% 
  arrange(Species, location, disease) -> prevalence_longer
prevalence_longer
```

## Making wider, different ways

```{r}
prevalence_longer %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=c(Species, location), values_from=frequency)
```

```{r}
prevalence_longer %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=location, values_from=frequency)
```


## Interlude

```{r}
pigs_longer %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarize(weight_mean=mean(weight))
```

## What if summary is more than one number?

eg. quartiles:

```{r, error=T}
pigs_longer %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarize(r=quantile(weight, c(0.25, 0.75)))
```

## the right way to do it

```{r}
pigs_longer %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarize(r=list(quantile(weight, c(0.25, 0.75)))) %>% 
  unnest(r)
```


## or, even better, use `enframe`:

```{r}
quantile(pigs_longer$weight, c(0.25, 0.75))
enframe(quantile(pigs_longer$weight, c(0.25, 0.75)))
```


## A nice look

```{r, warning=FALSE}
pigs_longer %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarize(r=list(enframe(quantile(weight, c(0.25, 0.75))))) %>% 
  unnest(r) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=name, values_from=value)
```


## A hairy one

18 people receive one of three treatments. At 3 different times (pre, post, followup) two variables `y` and `z` are measured on each person:

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
repmes0 <- read_table2("repmes.txt")
repmes0 %>% mutate(id=str_c(treatment, ".", rep)) %>% 
  select(-rep) %>% 
  select(id, everything()) -> repmes
repmes
```

## Attempt 1


```{r}
repmes %>% pivot_longer(contains("_"),
                        names_to=c("time", "var"),
                        names_sep="_"
                         )
```

## Attempt 2

```{r}
repmes %>% pivot_longer(contains("_"),
                        names_to=c("time", ".value"),
                        names_sep="_"
                        ) -> repmes3
repmes3
```

## make a graph

```{r}
ggplot(repmes3, aes(x=fct_inorder(time), y=y, 
                    colour=treatment, group=id)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

## or do the plot with means

```{r, echo=F}
repmes3 %>% group_by(treatment, ftime=fct_inorder(time)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_y=mean(y)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=ftime, y=mean_y, colour=treatment, group=treatment)) + 
    geom_point() + geom_line()
```
